# Color Quantization & Dithering Experiment  

This repository contains source code for a **Computer Vision & AI** homework assignment at **HSLU**. The project explores **color quantization** and **dithering** techniques.  

## üöÄ Streamlit Demo

üîó **[Auto-Pixler Streamlit App](https://auto-pixler.streamlit.app)**  

## üìÇ Project Overview  
This project experiments with different **color quantization** and **dithering** algorithms to reduce image colors while maintaining visual quality.

### üé® Color Quantization

Color quantization reduces the number of colors in an image while trying to keep it looking similar. This is useful for compression, old-school graphics, and printing. It works by grouping similar colors together and replacing them with fewer representative colors.

### üñºÔ∏è Dithering

Dithering is a technique used to fake missing colors by blending pixels of different colors. It creates the illusion of more colors by placing different-colored pixels next to each other. This is common in old video games and black-and-white printing.

üî¢ K-Means Clustering

K-means is a way to group data into K clusters. In color quantization, it helps find the best K colors to represent an image. It works by:

1. Picking K random colors.
2. Assigning every pixel to the closest color.
3. Updating the colors to be the average of their assigned pixels.
4. Repeating until things stop changing.
